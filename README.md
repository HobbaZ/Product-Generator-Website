# Product-Generator-Website
This website generates a product title and description from various arrays, displays an internet address mockup and an app name mock up as well. This is in the get it working before making it fancy stage of development atm.

### Inspiration
This website was inspired by one day looking at some portfolio examples and clicking inspect to see barely any HTML with seemingly empty divs for sections, I found this strange occurance was the result of JavaScript. I cracked open my ancient JavaScript textbook and found the innerHTML property, that day I also saw a cool portfolio generator on Reddit and decided that I too, could make my own portfolio generator.

### Known Issues
Most of the arrays are global, I've now learnt that it is better to have them in the local function.
You'll notice that if you click the button a few times, some choices will always show up together, this is probably a problem with the global arrays, I'll eventually rewrite the site to work better.

### Technology used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a lot of googling and a 20 year old Javascript textbook.
